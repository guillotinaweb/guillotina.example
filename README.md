# Guillotina Example

Just a small example application for [guillotina](https://github.com/plone/guillotina).

A good starting point for looking at this repo might be the `Makefile` targets.

Most files are annotated to try and help explain things, or at least point a
reader in the direction of better/more thorough documentation.
