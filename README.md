# pserver.example

Just a small example application for [plone.server](https://github.com/plone/plone.server).

This example has a slightly different intention than the
[plone.example](https://github.com/plone/plone.server/tree/master/src/plone.example)
in the plone.server repo --  it's not affiliated with the project, and is more
for me to poke around plone.server and to have annotations that are helpful for
someone not familiar with concepts pervasive in Zope/Plone.

A good starting point for looking at this repo might be the `Makefile` targets.

wrong, or could just do better -- please feel free to create an issue or a

## NOTE

  - The [config.json.md](config.json.md) file is annotated with normal javascript
    comments, where the [config.json](config.json) file is a valid json document
