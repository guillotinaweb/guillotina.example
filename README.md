# Guillotina Example

Just a small example application for [guillotina](https://github.com/plone/guillotina).

This project is not affiliated with the project, and is more for me to poke
around guillotina.

I've tried to do a lot of annotation to this repo to help remind me of what
certain things are, but also to try and be helpful to other people that may
be interested in looking around.

A good starting point for looking at this repo might be the `Makefile` targets.

wrong, or could just do better -- please feel free to create an issue or a

## NOTE

  - The [config.json.md](config.json.md) file is annotated with normal javascript
    comments, where the [config.json](config.json) file is a valid json document
